<h1>DEDALO</h1>
<div align="justify">
  
DEDALO provides a framework to design an informed proposal distribution in the context of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms employed to find the agent-based stochastic user equilibrium in  <a href="https://matsim.org/">MATSim</a>  . The proposal distribution is used to select new travel choices (e.g., transport mode between two activity, departure time, routes) in an activity-based model, which represents the daily plan of every agent in the synthetic population. In order to obtain a better convergence rate and reduce the auto-correlation between samples, the proposal distribution needs  to  approximate  the  target  distribution  which  is  considered,  in  this  work,  a  mixture-logit model.  However, to be computationally efficient, this requires to solve two main obstacles.  The first one stems from the combinatorial nature of all the possible choices a traveler deals with during a daily plan and the second one is due to the unknown stochastic disturbance the agent faces during the execution of his/her plan as a result of the stochastic decisions of all the other agens.  The aim of this work is to overcome these obstacles, providing the agents  with  an  augmented  capacity  to  forecast  the  choices  of  the  other  agents by  knowing  the probability of their decisions.
